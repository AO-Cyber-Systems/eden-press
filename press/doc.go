// Package press is Eden Press's public API (API-03): the ONE package a
// consumer imports to render a complete Marp-compatible deck from Markdown
// -- HTML + packed CSS + the JSON-serializable document model -- with no
// JavaScript runtime, no Node, and no browser (OBJECTIVE.md success
// criterion 4).
//
// press.Render (defined in wave 3, TRD 03-09) is a SIBLING composition to
// chase.Render, not a wrapper: it drives its OWN battery-laden goldmark
// engine -- emoji (CORE-06), syntax highlighting via chroma (CORE-04/05),
// LaTeX-to-MathML (CORE-07/08), and an always-on bluemonday sanitize pass
// (CORE-05) -- through the SAME two-phase, one-parse flow chase already
// uses, via the additive chase/markdown.ParseWithEngine seam this objective
// introduces (TRD 03-01). It never touches chase.Render or chase/chase.go;
// every existing chase caller stays byte-for-byte unaffected.
//
// This file (doc.go) carries only the package documentation. The public
// surface itself lives in options.go: the Options input struct and the
// Output result struct -- the frozen API-03 contract every wave-2 battery
// TRD and the wave-3 compose TRD (03-09) consume, and the shape Objective
// 7's Dart binding serializes over. Those types are defined once, here in
// press/, so the downstream binding never has to chase per-battery API
// churn.
//
// Invariant: press/ never imports a headless-browser driver. `go list -deps
// ./press/...` must never contain chromedp -- Eden Press renders HTML and
// structured data without ever launching a browser, and that promise is
// enforced from the very first file in this package.
