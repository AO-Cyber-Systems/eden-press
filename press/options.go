// Options configures press.Render (defined in TRD 03-09). This is the frozen
// API-03 input surface: it is defined once, here, and every wave-2 battery TRD
// and Objective 7's Dart binding builds against it, so it must stay stable --
// add a field only when a named consumer needs it, never speculatively.
//
// Its ZERO VALUE (press.Options{}) is a valid, Marp-Core-matching
// configuration: every field's zero value MEANS "do what Marp Core does by
// default", so press.Render(md, press.Options{}) just works. Two fields are
// deliberately shaped so their zero value is the SAFE default rather than an
// off/empty one -- NoHighlight is inverted (zero => highlighting ON) and
// Sanitize is nil-defaulted (zero => the built-in always-on policy applies).
type Options struct {
	// Theme selects the named theme. "" resolves the deck's own front-matter
	// `theme:` directive, and absent that, Marp Core's built-in "default"
	// theme. A non-empty value overrides the front matter.
	Theme string

	// Profile selects the chase/profile.Profile that supplies the unit element
	// and scaffold CSS. "" resolves profile.Default() (today: "slides", the
	// only registered profile).
	Profile string

	// InlineSVG selects the inline-<svg><foreignObject> container mode. The
	// 03-09 baseline turns this on to match Marp Core; the flag's own zero
	// value is false and is documented here without any speculative inversion.
	InlineSVG bool

	// MathMode selects the math rendering backend. "" resolves to "mathml"
	// (the CORE-07/08 baseline); "off" disables math rendering. Objective 8
	// hardens the fallback rules on top of this baseline.
	MathMode string

	// NoHighlight disables syntax highlighting when true. It is INVERTED on
	// purpose: the zero value (false) leaves highlighting ON, matching Marp
	// Core's default, so an Options{} caller keeps chroma highlighting without
	// having to opt in.
	NoHighlight bool

	// HighlightStyle names the chroma style used when highlighting is on. ""
	// resolves the default style pre-verified against the .hljs class remap
	// (CORE-04/05, TRD 03-05).
	HighlightStyle string

	// Sanitize is the HTML sanitization policy applied to the composed output.
	// nil (the zero value) does NOT disable sanitization -- it selects the
	// built-in always-on policy. CORE-05 sanitization is not optional; a
	// caller may supply a stricter/looser *bluemonday.Policy, but never turn
	// it off by leaving this nil.
	Sanitize *bluemonday.Policy
}

// Output is press.Render's result -- the frozen API-03 output contract, the
// stable shape Objective 7's Dart binding serializes to JSON. It mirrors
// chase.Output (HTML/CSS/Model/Meta) and adds Comments, the flattened speaker
// notes already carried by the model.
type Output struct {
	// HTML is the battery-composed, post-sanitize rendered deck HTML.
	HTML string

	// CSS is the packed theme CSS (chase/theme ThemeSet.Pack output).
	CSS string

	// Model is the JSON-serializable document model, exactly as
	// chase/model.Build produces it -- unchanged by the press batteries.
	Model *model.Document

	// Meta is a convenience alias for Model.Meta (deck-level front-matter
	// metadata), surfaced top-level so a caller wanting only metadata need not
	// reach through Model.
	Meta model.Meta

	// Comments is the deck's speaker notes flattened into document order: the
	// aggregation of every model.Section.Notes entry across Model.Sections.
	// It is []string (never a nested shape) -- the exact contract the Dart
	// binding serializes. It is NOT a fresh AST walk; model.Section.Notes is
	// already populated by chase/model.Build.
	Comments []string
