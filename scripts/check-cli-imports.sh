# check-cli-imports.sh is the mechanical enforcement of CLI-04's boundary
# gate (04-08-TRD.md): cmd/eden-press's OWN source may import press/ (and
# its subpackages, e.g. press/themes, press/math) plus stdlib/third-party
# deps, but must NEVER directly import chase/, profiles/, or chromedp. This
# is the CLI analogue of API-02's check-no-chromedp.sh gate, one level down
# at the "CLI is a consumer of press/ only" boundary (the Objective-3
# consumer boundary).
#
# This checks .Imports -- the package's OWN DIRECT imports -- NOT a
# transitive `go list -deps` scan, which would legitimately show
# chase/profiles VIA press (allowed; the boundary is about the CLI's own
# source, not what press/ composes underneath it).
#
# Wired into CI (.github/workflows/ci.yml) beside check-no-chromedp.sh and
# runnable locally via `make check-cli-imports`.
