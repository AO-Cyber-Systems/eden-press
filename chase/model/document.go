// Package model is Eden Press's own versioned, JSON-serializable document
// model (the "docmodel"): Document{Meta, Sections, Outline}. This is
// differentiator #3 ("output-as-data") made a first-class package on day
// one, per ARCHITECTURE.md Pattern 3.
//
// goldmark's ast.Node tree is a transient parse-time working structure: it
// references source-buffer segments rather than owning copies of text, has
// no built-in JSON marshaling, and its shape is an internal implementation
// detail of whichever goldmark version chase/markdown happens to be built
// against. Document is the durable product a consumer (Eden-Biz, AOCore, an
// LLM ingestion pipeline) actually wants -- outline/notes/metadata WITHOUT
// parsing rendered HTML back out of HTML.
//
// Document is built by Build (see build.go): a read-only, direct recursive
// walk of the SAME finalized *ast.Document chase/markdown/seam.go's Parse
// returns -- the exact tree chase/markdown's own goldmark renderer
// consumes to produce HTML. Never a second parse; never reverse-engineered
// from rendered HTML.
package model

// SchemaVersion identifies the shape of Document below. It is owned and
// versioned independently of goldmark/Marp upstream churn (ARCHITECTURE.md
// Pattern 3's trade-off note: "a schema you now own and must version"). A
// future incompatible change to Document's JSON shape bumps this constant,
// giving a consumer a stable signal to branch on rather than silently
// misinterpreting an old/new shape.
//
// v1 -> v2 (06-01): ADDITIVE per-section body-content enrichment. Section
// gained a Blocks []Block field (ordered paragraph/list/code/math/heading
// content, materialized by the SAME single read-only Build walk). Every new
// field carries `omitempty`, so a v1-shaped (block-less) document's JSON is
// byte-for-byte unchanged apart from this version string -- v2 is a strict
// superset of v1, never a breaking reshape.
//
// v2 -> v3 (EPD-R1, AODex Objective 11): table/image/quote block kinds.
// Mostly additive -- a GFM table's and an image's content were previously
// ABSENT from the model entirely (measured: a table's cell text appeared
// nowhere in the serialized Document, so a consumer reading the model could
// not recover it by any means), and now materialize as table/image Blocks.
// The version bump is NOT merely for those additions, though: a blockquote
// previously emitted an indistinguishable BlockParagraph and now emits
// BlockQuote instead. That RE-CLASSIFIES output a v2 consumer would already
// have seen for the same input, so v3 is a deliberate, signalled change
// rather than a silent v2 extension -- exactly the branch signal this
// constant exists to give.
//
// v3 -> v4 (AODex Objective 16): ADDITIVE source positions. Section, Block and
// OutlineEntry each gained an optional Span -- a half-open [start, stop) BYTE
// range into the Markdown source -- materialized from the text.Segment bounds
// the SAME single Build walk already visited and previously discarded.
//
// Nothing is re-classified. No existing field changed meaning, shape or
// presence: a v3 consumer that ignores unknown keys sees byte-for-byte the
// same document apart from this version string. That is the OPPOSITE of
// v2 -> v3, which moved blockquotes off BlockParagraph and therefore genuinely
// required a consumer to look. The superset claim is PROVEN, not asserted --
// TestV4IsAStrictSupersetOfV3 strips every `span` key from a v4 render and
// compares the result to a golden captured from the pre-bump v3 tree.
//
// The bump happens anyway because this schema versions its SHAPE, not only its
// breaking changes -- the same reason v1 -> v2 bumped for a purely additive
// Blocks field.
//
// Why positions at all: without them an editor cannot map an outline click to
// a source offset, and reconstructing Section boundaries client-side means
// replicating headingDivider's SYNTHETIC thematic breaks (which appear in no
// source text whatsoever) and goldmark's setext-heading precedence in another
// language.
const SchemaVersion = "eden-press.model/v4"

// Span is a half-open byte range [Start, Stop) into the Markdown source that
// produced the node carrying it: source[Start:Stop] re-slices that node's
// original text. Half-open matches Go slice semantics exactly, so the re-slice
// needs no arithmetic at the call site.
//
// OFFSETS ARE BYTES -- not runes, and not UTF-16 code units. A client whose
// strings are UTF-16 (Dart, JavaScript) MUST convert before indexing, or every
// position after the first multi-byte character will be wrong. Emitting bytes
// is deliberate rather than convenient: text.Segment carries bytes, this
// package's Go consumers (the DOCX/PPTX/XLSX writers) want bytes, and baking
// one client's string model into a general-purpose library would be the wrong
// trade. TestSpansAreByteOffsets pins this with an accented word and an emoji,
// and proves a rune-indexed and a UTF-16-indexed read of the same numbers are
// both wrong.
//
// Span is a POINTER on its owners, with NON-omitempty inner fields. That shape
// is load-bearing, not stylistic: `Start int json:"start,omitempty"` would drop
// a legitimate offset 0 -- the first block of every document, i.e. exactly the
// node a "scroll to top" targets -- making it indistinguishable from an
// unpositioned node. Nil-or-present at the outer level; 0 serializes fine at
// the inner level. It also keeps v3 JSON byte-for-byte unchanged for any node
// whose position cannot be determined, preserving the strict-superset property
// v2 established. TestFirstBlockSpanSurvivesJSON pins both halves.
//
// A node whose position cannot be determined carries a NIL Span, never a
// fabricated {0, 0}: a fabricated span sends an editor's cursor to the top of
// the document, which is worse than no cursor at all.
