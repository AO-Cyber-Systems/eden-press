# check-no-chromedp enforces API-02: the public render path (press/) and
# everything it composes (chase/, profiles/) must carry NO chromedp dependency.
# See scripts/check-no-chromedp.sh; wired into .github/workflows/ci.yml beside
# the addlicense header check.
check-no-chromedp:

# check-cli-imports enforces CLI-04 (04-08-TRD.md): cmd/eden-press's OWN
# source must import ONLY press/ from the engine -- never chase/, profiles/,
# or chromedp directly (a transitive scan legitimately shows chase/profiles
# VIA press; this checks .Imports, the CLI's own DIRECT imports, only). See
# scripts/check-cli-imports.sh; wired into .github/workflows/ci.yml beside
# check-no-chromedp.

# CHROME_VERSION is the SINGLE pinned chromedp/headless-shell tag eden-press's
# export path is validated against -- NEVER "latest" (05-RESEARCH Pitfall
# A/11: two independently-documented Chrome regressions hit the PDF export
# path ONLY, so a silent version drift can regress PDF export while every
# PNG/screenshot-path test keeps passing). This is the canonical value;
# .github/workflows/ci.yml's `export` job container tag references this SAME
# version -- bump both together, then re-run `make check-chrome-export`
# (which enforces the PDF-path re-validation rule) before accepting the
# bump. See convert/EXPORT.md for the full process.

# export-test runs convert/'s export test suite (convert/chrome,
# convert/pdf, convert/png, and the 05-05 press.Render->ToPDF/ToImages
# capstone), expecting Chrome to be discovered via the EXP-04 fallback
# chain. Chrome-presence-gated: cleanly t.Skips outside a provisioned
# Chrome/container.

# export-binary-smoke builds cmd/eden-press-export and drives a real pdf+png
# export of a fixture deck through the compiled binary -- the turnkey CLI
# path (05.1-01/05.1-02), distinct from export-test (which exercises
# convert/ directly, not the binary's argv/file-writing surface). Self
# -gating: the binary exits 3 when no Chrome is discoverable, which the
# script treats as a clean skip, so a local run without Chrome no-ops
# instead of failing. Wired into the CI export job beside export-test.
