// Options is the shared cross-exporter option surface both convert/pdf and

	// StartTimeout bounds how long browser ALLOCATION may take -- the launch
	// plus the DevTools handshake -- before New gives up and returns an error.
	// Zero means DefaultStartTimeout.
	//
	// This exists because there was previously no bound at all: allocation ran
	// against context.Background(), so a browser that never became usable left
	// the caller blocked forever with nothing logged. A hang is unobservable by
	// construction -- no error, no exit code -- and this one took down an
	// export sidecar in production, where the readiness endpoint that called it
	// simply stopped answering.
	//
	// It covers two different failures. A browser can fail to complete its
	// DevTools handshake at all, or it can complete the handshake and then
	// stall before its first tab is usable. The production incident was the
	// second kind: the websocket connection was established, and Chrome's
	// crash-looping GPU process then starved the renderer so it never answered
	// Runtime.enable. Set BrowserLog to tell the two apart.
	//
	// It bounds ONLY startup. The browser's own lifetime stays tied to an
	// unbounded context, because a deadline there would kill a healthy
	// long-lived Session mid-render.
	StartTimeout time.Duration

	// BrowserLog, when non-nil, receives Chrome's combined stdout+stderr for
	// the browser's entire lifetime. When nil, that output is discarded -- but
	// the pipe is still created and still drained.
	//
	// That distinction is not cosmetic, and it is the difference between
	// diagnosing a failed launch and guessing at one. chromedp reads Chrome's
	// output only until it finds the "DevTools listening on" line; from there
	// it branches on whether a writer was configured, and with NO writer it
	// CLOSES the output pipe outright. Every line Chrome emits after startup is
	// then destroyed at the source.
	//
	// Two failed production deploys produced zero browser diagnostics for
	// exactly this reason: Chrome's GPU process was crash-looping and saying so
	// continuously, but the crash-loop begins after the websocket URL is parsed
	// -- that is, after chromedp had already closed the pipe. Setting this
	// writer surfaced the root cause on the first run afterwards.
	//
	// Leaving it nil is safe and is the default; convert/chrome substitutes
	// io.Discard rather than passing nil through, so the pipe is never closed
	// out from under a browser that still has something to say.
