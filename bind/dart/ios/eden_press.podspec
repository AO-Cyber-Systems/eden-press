# CocoaPods spec for the eden_press Flutter FFI plugin.
#
# The native code is the Go c-archive scripts/build-ios.sh packages as
# EdenPress.xcframework (device arm64 + a lipo'd arm64/x86_64 simulator slice).
# It is consumed as a prebuilt vendored framework; this pod compiles no
# Objective-C of its own beyond the placeholder in Classes/.
#
# static_framework is REQUIRED, not stylistic: the payload is a STATIC archive
# (.a inside the xcframework), and Go's iOS support builds c-archive rather
# than c-shared. That is also why lib/src/native_loader.dart uses
# DynamicLibrary.process() on iOS instead of .open() — the symbols are linked
# into the app binary itself, so there is no separate library to open.
#
# The xcframework is NOT committed (.gitignore excludes *.xcframework/). Run
# `make dart-native-vendor` after scripts/build-ios.sh to place it here.
