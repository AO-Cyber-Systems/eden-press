// Package paged implements chase/profile.Profile for long-form paged
// documents — reports and articles on A4/Letter stock, as opposed to
// profiles/slides' 16:9 deck.
//
// It is the SECOND Profile implementation, and the first real test of whether
// chase/profile is the extensible abstraction it was designed to be. It is
// mostly not: building this profile required adding
// Profile.ContainerClass() and a matching seam in chase/markdown, because the
// container's DOM class was a "marpit" literal in renderDocument while the
// interface supplied only the CSS selector. Everything else — the unit
// element, the size table, the pagination rule, the scaffold CSS — did slot in
// as designed.
//
// What this profile deliberately does NOT provide, because the Profile
// interface has no method for it: a table of contents. Page geometry, running
// headers/footers and page numbers are all expressible as @page rules and CSS
// counters in Scaffold(), and are implemented here. A TOC needs GENERATED DOM
// built from model.Document.Outline, and a Profile only supplies CSS-shaped
// tables and predicates — it never injects content. A TOC therefore belongs at
// the press/ level (or needs a content-injection method on the interface); it
// is not something this package could deliver by itself.

// UnitElement is the element theme rules are scoped onto. It stays "section"
// — the same generic unit slides uses. chase/model deliberately carries no

// structural unit split by the same "---" boundary; only their geometry and
// pagination differ.

// ContainerClass is the class the rendered run's wrapping <div> carries.
// Deliberately NOT "marpit": this profile has nothing to do with Marp, and

// a stylesheet written for one profile silently apply to the other.

// The inlineSVG branch that slides uses does not apply here: Marpit's
// inline-SVG mode exists to scale a fixed-aspect slide to any viewport, which

// enables inline SVG against this profile gets CSS that still matches.

// chase/theme's Size carries.
//
// A4 is 210x297mm -> 210/25.4*96 = 793.7 -> 794 x 1123 px.
// Letter is 8.5x11in -> 816 x 1056 px.
// Both are rounded to whole pixels; sub-pixel page boxes cause visible
// 1px seams when a renderer rasterizes page edges.
//
// A4 is the default: it is the standard for the large majority of the world,
// and Letter remains one directive away.

// Pagination describes where the page-number counter attaches. Like slides it
// targets the unit's ::after pseudo-element, but the default content
// expression is this profile's own CSS counter rather than Marpit's
// data-marpit-pagination attribute — a paged document numbers pages from a
// counter that increments per section, not from an attribute the Marp
// directive system stamps on.

// Scaffold returns the base CSS prepended before a packed theme's own rules.

// The inlineSVG argument is ignored: advanced backgrounds are a slide-deck
// construct built on Marpit's inline-SVG layer, which this profile does not
// use (see Container).
