// newRootCmd builds the eden-press root command: it runs CONVERT BY DEFAULT
// when invoked with zero or one positional argument and no subcommand
// (`eden-press deck.md` just works), while also registering convert/watch/
// serve/preview as explicit subcommands.
//
// Pitfall 1 (cobra positional-arg vs subcommand-name collision, research
// Pitfall 1): cobra resolves a bare positional argument that EXACTLY
// MATCHES a registered subcommand's Use name (convert/watch/serve/preview)
// AS that subcommand, not as a filename -- so `eden-press watch` runs the
// watch subcommand even if the user meant a file literally named "watch".
// The documented escape hatch is `--`, which tells cobra/pflag "everything
// after this is a positional argument, never a subcommand or flag":
// `eden-press convert -- watch.md` unambiguously treats "watch.md" as the
// input file. This is surfaced in the root's Long help (below) rather than
// silently worked around, per the TRD's Pitfall-1 guard.
func newRootCmd() *cobra.Command {
	root := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "eden-press [flags] <in.md|->",
		Short: "Render Marp-compatible Markdown decks -- no JS, no Node, no browser",
		Long: `eden-press renders a Marp-compatible Markdown deck to zero-JS static HTML.

Running "eden-press <in.md>" with no subcommand converts the deck by
default. Reading from stdin: "eden-press -" (or piping into "eden-press").

Pitfall: a positional argument that EXACTLY matches a subcommand name
(convert, watch, serve, preview) is resolved by cobra AS that subcommand,
not as a filename. If your input file happens to be named e.g. "watch.md"
(or bare "watch"), disambiguate with "--":

    eden-press convert -- watch.md
    eden-press -- watch`,
		Args:         cobra.MaximumNArgs(1),
		SilenceUsage: true,
		PersistentPreRunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, _ []string) error {
			return applyConfig(cmd)
		},
		RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
			return runConvert(cmd, args)
		},
